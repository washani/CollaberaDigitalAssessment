#### React Native doesn't use HTML tags like <a> directly. Navigation components such as navigation bars or drawer navigators are typically implemented using the react-navigation library.

#### In this assessment, I will focus on the navbar in mobile apps and the drawer navigator since <a> tags are not supported in React Native.
