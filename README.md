React Native doesn't use HTML tags like <a> directly. Navigation components such as navigation bars or drawer navigators are typically implemented using the react-navigation library.

In this assessment, I will focus on the navbar in mobile apps and the drawer navigator since <a> tags are not supported in React Native.

Within one project, I have added all three challenges as separate screens. To check the third challenge screen, you need to view the console log.
